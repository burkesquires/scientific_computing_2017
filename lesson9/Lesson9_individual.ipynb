One way to correct this problem is to check that the user enters “yes” or “no”. Modify your `build_list` ***pseudocode*** here so your program checks if the user enters “yes” or “no” to the question. If the user types something else (such as a number), your algorithm should ask the user for another answer, until the user finally enters “yes” or “no”. The first step to designing your pseudocode is to select an appropriate programming construct (sequential, branching, predetermined loops, or unknown number of loops)."
