    "The coordinate system is a method of specifying points of interest by defining distances from a fixed reference point. Typically, the most familiar representation is Cartesian coordinates, a rectangular system of measurement that enables you to locate points using horizontal and vertical coordinates. The horizontal values, called X-coordinates, are measured along the X-axis. The vertical values, called Y-coordinates, are measured along the Y-axis. The intersection of the X- and Y-axes is called the origin point, which represents the 0,0 location of the coordinate system.  Some physical systems, however, are more intuitively represented by specifying the distance and the direction from a given point. This mode of measurement is quite helpful in working with angles.  Identifying an appropriate coordinate system is one of the first, most important steps in solving many physical problems."
