We will also start increasing the modularity of our code by defining functions that do useful pieces of calcualtions then bringing them together into a final function that calls several other earlier functions. This will make more sense when you get into the activity. One thing to watch out for though, is that you want to make sure that you are using `return` and not `print`ing stuff. Really none of the functions in this assignment need to `print` anything."
