The purpose of this assignment is to get you more familiar and proficient with the Jupyter Notebooks (JN) -- using markdown, saving and exporting JNs, uploading JNs to Canvas -- and to gather some information about you.

Here is the template JN file: intro_jupyter_assignment_template.ipynb

Answer the questions in the notebook, rename it, and use markdown to format your assignment *exactly* like mine:

Then, when you are done, submit your JN (as an ipynb file). It is also a good idea for you to export it as an html file so that you can view it in a web browser. This is the best way to share the files with people who do not have JN installed.
