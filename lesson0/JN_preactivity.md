<li>Find and fire up the Jupyter Notebook application (it actually launches a web server, but don't worry about that too much)
<li>Make a new notebook
<li>Save it (save it somewhere sensible!)
<li>In markdown cells, answer the following questions:
<br>A. Describe the difference between "command" mode and "edit" mode.
<br>B. How do you switch between "command" mode and "edit" mode
<br>C. How do you use the keyboard (not mouse/trackpad) to switch a cell from code to markdown, and markdown to code?
<br>(at this point don't worry about formatting, that's part of the next activity)</ol>
